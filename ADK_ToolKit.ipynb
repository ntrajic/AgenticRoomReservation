        "\n",
        "Welcome, Agent Architect! This notebook is your definitive guide to giving AI agents superpowers through **tool integration**. An agent's true power isn't just its language model; it's its ability to connect to and interact with the outside world. We will explore the entire spectrum of tool integration patterns available in the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK).\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this adventure, you will master how to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- ✅ **Use Built-in & Custom Function Tools**: The foundational patterns for giving an agent new skills.\n",
        "- ✅ **Generate Tools from Specifications**: Automatically create toolsets from **OpenAPI** specs and connect to enterprise APIs in **Google Cloud API Hub**.\n",
        "- ✅ **Connect to Live Tool Servers**: Use **MCP** to have your agent dynamically discover tools hosted anywhere on the web.\n",
        "- ✅ **Integrate with Other Frameworks**: Seamlessly use tools from the **LangChain** ecosystem directly within your ADK agent.\n",
        "- ✅ **Share State Between Tools**: Use `ToolContext` to enable complex, multi-step workflows where tools can pass information to each other.\n",
        "- ✅ **Build Multi-Agent Systems**: Create sophisticated systems where a primary \"orchestrator\" agent can delegate tasks to specialist agents.\n",
